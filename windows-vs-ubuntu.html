            though its about pricing, security, or everything else.
         </p>
         <p class="mt-5 technology-heading">Reasons that make ubuntu more preferable than to windows</p>

         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Free and Open Source</h4>

         <p class="body-text">Ubuntu or GNU/Linux) is a free and open-source server platform; you can see the source
            code used to make Linux. You can check the code to find bugs, investigate security weaknesses, or
            essentially study what that code is doing on your machine. </p>
         <p class="body-text">Also, you may effectively create and introduce your own projects into a Linux operating
            system due to various accessible software interfaces you need. With all the highlighted features, you can
            tailor a Ubuntu server platform at its most fundamental levels, to suit your server needs not at all like
            Windows.</p>

         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">2. Stability and Reliability</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            Buntu Linux is Unix-based operating system and Unix was initially intended to give an environment that is
            amazing, steady, dependable and simple to utilize. Linux server is broadly known for their stability and
            trustworthy quality, numerous Linux server on the Internet has been running for quite a long time without
            disappointment or in any event, being restarted.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">
            The inquiry is the thing that really makes Ubuntu Linux server stable. There are numerous determinants which
            incorporate administration of system and projects' setups, measure the board, security usage among others.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">
            In Linux, you can easily edit or update the software or program services record and impact the progressions
            without essentially rebooting the server, which is not even possible in the Windows server system. It
            likewise offers productive and dependable components of the process of the board. On the off chance that a
            process is carrying on strangely, you can impart it a suitable sign utilizing orders, for example,
            slaughter, pkill and killall, in this way managing any implication on the general performance structure of
            an operating system.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">Linux is additionally secure, it profoundly confines impact from outside sources (clients,
            projects or frameworks) that can destabilize a server.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">3. Security</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            Linux is, without doubt, the most secure kernel out there, making Linux based operating systems secure and
            suitable for servers. To be useful, a server needs to be able to accept requests for services from remote
            clients, and a server is always vulnerable by permitting some access to its ports.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">
            However, Linux implements a variety of security mechanisms to secure files and services from attacks and
            abuses. You can secure services using programs such as a firewall (for example ip-tables), TCP wrappers (to
            allow and deny service access), and Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) which helps to limit the resources a
            service can access on a server.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">
            SELinux ensures for instance that an HTTP server, FTP server, Samba server, or DNS server can access only a
            restricted set of files on the system as defined by file contexts and allow only a restricted set of
            features as defined by Booleans.
         </p>

         <p class="body-text">A number of Linux distributions such as Fedora, RHEL/CentOS, and a few others ship in with
            SELinux feature included and enabled by default. However, you can disable SELinux temporarily or
            permanently, if need be.</p>
         <p class="body-text">All in all, in Linux, before any system user/group or program access a resource or
            executes a file/program it must have the appropriate permissions, otherwise any unauthorized action is
            always blocked.</p>

         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">4. Flexibility</h4>

         <p class="body-text">It offers many utilities/instruments (in-built tools) which you can look over to do such
            things as perform system open up and several other services, add clients, managed systems and circles,
            introduce programming, screen execution and by and large make sure about and deal with your server. It
            additionally empowers you to pick either to introduce binary files or build programs from source code. </p>
         <p class="body-text">Quite possibly the most remarkable standard projects present in Ubuntu Linux server is the
            shell, is a program that furnishes you with a predictable climate for running different projects in Linux;
            it encourages you to connect with the bit itself. </p>
         <p class="body-text">Critically, the Linux shell gives useful software builds that let you decide, execute
            orders consistently, make new capacities/utilities/tools, and robotized day by day server organization
            projects. </p>

         <p class="body-text">Essentially, Linux gives you supreme authority over a machine, assisting you with building
            and alter a server simply the manner as like you need. </p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">5. Hardware Support</h4>

         <p class="body-text">Linux has remarkable support for a blend of PC structure, on both current and respectably
            prior version hardware. This perhaps the main factors that improve Ubuntu Linux server than Windows, that is
            in the event that you have a low budget plan for hardware procurement. </p>
         <p class="body-text">Linux generally supports old hardware, for instance, the Slackware Linux site is
            facilitated on Pentium III, 600 MHz, with 512 megabytes of RAM. You can discover the rundown of support
            equipment and related requirements for a particular conveyance from their official sites.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">6. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Maintenance</h4>

         <p class="body-text">The complete expense of claiming and keeping a Linux server is lower contrasted with a
            Windows server, regarding permitting charges, software/hardware buying and maintenance costs, the system
            supports services and desired cost. </p>
         <p class="body-text">Except if you are running an exclusive Linux dispersion, for example, RHEL or SUSE server
            Linux which require membership, for you to get excellent help and services, you will experience reasonable
            expenses while running a Linux server.</p>

In spite of the fact that NodeJS may appear as though a substitute for PHP, however, NodeJS developmemt services won't replace it. PHP's versatility and flexibility for web applications and sites can't be overtaken by NodeJS. Simultaneously, NodeJS is productive in enormous solicitations. Along these lines, both are autonomous and selective with regards to activities."
