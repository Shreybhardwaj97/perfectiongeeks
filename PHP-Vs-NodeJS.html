            Crafted and introduced by Rasmus Lerdorf, a decades ago, PHP made its debut in the IT industry in 1995. PHP
            which in full referred to as Personal Home Page but now the recursive back name for PHP is Hypertext
            Preprocessor. This is an open-source, server-side scripting language which is specifically developed with an
            intention to build multi-features integrated well-functioning websites.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">
            Dissimilar to other top-rated programming languages, PHP developed without a reviewed formal determination
            until 2014. The first execution of the programming language went about as the true norm up until that point.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">
            Despite the fact that PHP is a server-side scripting language, it can likewise be utilized for different
            purposes. PHP scripts have an (.php) expansion and contain a mix of CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and even plain
            content. As of now, PHP is one of the main programming languages to find a new line of work or to start a
            career in the IT industry.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">
            Facebook, Flickr, Wikipedia, Yahoo, and Tumblr are the names of some majorly used web portals that have been
            fabricated utilizing the PHP programming language.

            Created by Ryan Dahl, Node.js unveiled its first appearance over a decade back in May of 2009. With the
            presentation of Node.js, it got conceivable to make pure and complex JS applications that can work outside
            the internet browser platform.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">
            An open-source, server side JavaScript programming stage, Node.js is based on top of Chrome's V8 JavaScript
            motor. Nodejs follows an occasion driven engineering with a non-hindering I/O ability making it appropriate
            for growing quick and exceptionally adaptable applications.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">
            This technology uses .JS extension with the document expansion and contain complete JavaScript code.
            GoDaddy, IBM, LinkedIn, Netflix, PayPal, and Walmart are the well-known, majorly used and most remarkable
            instances of Node.js.
         </p>
         <h5 class="mt-5 technology-heading">Similarities</h5>
         <p class="body-text font-weight-bold">
            <i>These two technologies have some top – level similarities. They are as per the following:</i>
         </p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Interpreted languages</h4>
         <p class="body-text">Node.js and PHP development, both are Interpreted web programming languages that merely
            like to be run in their own runtime surroundings</p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">2. Reasonable Choices</h4>
         <p class="body-text">Working on the server-side programming base, both PHP and Nodes.js are utilized to
            assemble multi-features accessible websites. They both have their own specialities that make them a perfect
            and must preferred technology stage over the other. Node.js is broader and quicker contrasted with PHP which
            may settle on it a more practical decision. Whether, a few developers inclines toward PHP just due to its
            easy nature in each aspect although it is about its database or programming, as PHP language is developed on
            a concept where everybody (beginner or expert) can use it hassle-freely, while just opposite to it, it's
            quite difficult for the newbies to work on Node.Js platform as node requires expertise.</p>
         <p class="mt-5 technology-heading">A quick round up to exhibit the differences between the two:</p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Runtime Environment </h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            PHP is integrated with ready to install features to access on server-side, while Node.js development
            platform likes to use the Javascript-based runtime stage to access on the server-side.
         </p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">2. Preferred Engines</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            PHP believes to be work under the Zend engine, while Node.js prefers Google’s V8 JavaScript engine.
         </p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">3. Code Complexity</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            Coding with PHP development platform is simpler as compared to Node.Js because it requires bigger code along
            with a hardcore understanding of closures and callback functions.
         </p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">4. Execution </h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            PHP trusts to work on the synchronous environment, while Node.js loves a synchronous environment for code
            execution
         </p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">5. Execution Speed</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            The code execution speed of Node.js is much faster as a comparison to the PHP because Node is a light
            weighted platform rather than PHP.
         </p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">6.Web Server</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            PHP prefers to run on Apache web server, and on IIS web server in case on Windows OS. Just opposite to it,
            Node did not require any web server, as it prefers its personalized runtime environment.

         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Centralized Server </h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            If we didn't have any particular plan or scaling for the website across numerous servers, then we can
            utilize LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) stack. This may change the contingent upon project requirements
            and development.
         </p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">2. Portability</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            PHP is a profoundly portable programming language. The modest expenses of the web facilitating and the
            accessibility of the servers for PHP is equivalent to none. PHP can run on practically any server stage that
            has Apache, IIS and an upheld information base framework introduced, this makes PHP applications compact and
            simple to upload. CMS resembles WordPress, Drupal or Joomla make it simpler to make websites and work on
            pretty much every web have.

         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Same Language across the Stack</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            Node.js will be the right decision to utilize if your project requires multiple programming stacks, for
            example, MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJs, AngularJs.), dynamic single-page applications, server-side tech
            stage and Front end innovations like Angular Js, Backbone.Js or React Js. This makes it simpler to have a
            similar language (Javascript) across your entire stack. You can likewise utilize Typescript library of
            Node.js if there should be an occurrence of an Angular project to make it simpler for the engineers. Mean
            stack is likewise simpler to scale than LAMP stack across numerous servers.
         </p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">2. Realtime Data</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            Node.js is extraordinary for web portals that require continuous information. Nonetheless, I would be
            incredulous about using Node.js for monetary applications as Javascript itself isn't dependable with regards
            to numbers as everything is an integer or float and very little partition is done between the sorts. A more
            kind of safe language is suggested when dealing with monetary applications that require a great deal of
            registering or a library that is sufficiently dependable.
         </p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">3. Speed</h4>
         <p class="body-text">
            Node.js development services is quicker than PHP development with regards to execution speed, if speed is
            the thing that you need for your application, for example, a program based multiplayer game or a talk
            application, then using Node.js is a beneficiary decision than PHP.

         <p class="mt-3 font-weight-bold"><em>There are two kinds of programming code:</em></p>
         <p class="body-text"><b class="font-weight-bold">Synchronous:</b> The code is executed on a line by line
            premise. The following line of simultaneous code is executed just when the execution of the past line of
            code has been finished.</p>
         <p class="body-text"><b class="font-weight-bold">Asynchronous:</b>Entire code is executed simultaneously.</p>
         <p class="body-text">PHPdevelopment is generally simultaneous except for some APIs that act in an asynchronous
            way. On the off chance that a past line of simultaneous code has a function that requires much effort to
            execute then the rest of the code needs to wait to get executed. All things considered, to enhance the
            actual execution time.</p>
         <p class="body-text">Node.js code, on the other side, is asynchronous. This implies that the JS motor goes
            through the whole code on the double and there is no requirement for sitting tight for a function to
            effectively finish execution. Thus, Node.js development can be exceptionally quick contrasted with PHP code.
         </p>
         <p class="body-text">There is, in any case, a catch with the asynchronous code. A program can stall out in
            callback damnation if there is a great deal of functions that should be affixed. It requires channelling
            information from one function to the next.</p>
         <p class="body-text">In any case, Node.js has a workaround for this issue. The async/anticipate the highlight
            of Node.js empowers a square of code to execute like that it was coordinated code.</p>

         <p class="body-text">Usually, PHP development is utilized with conventional or social information bases to any
            relational database of MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Whether there are approaches to utilize NoSQL
            database bases with PHP, doing so isn't so regular in the business.</p>
         <p class="body-text">Although Node.js works awesomely great with SQL database, the pattern is moving towards
            utilizing NoSQL data sets, for example, CouchDB and MongoDB.</p>
         <p class="body-text">SQL database, particularly MySQL are inclined to SQL infusion, cross-site scripting, and
            different assaults. However, NoSQL infusion assaults are an enrolled weakness for NoSQL-based database, the
            odds are a lot lesser than the SQL data sets.</p>
         <p class="body-text">This is so in light of the fact that NoSQL database plan theory opposes such assaults and
            furthermore the way that they are more current to the database scene.</p>
         <p class="mt-5 technology-heading">Development Stacks</p>
         <p class="body-text">Exchanging between various conditions and programming languages add to decreasing
            proficiency while composing the code. In addition, it very well may be maddening now and again.</p>
         <p class="body-text">While composing back-end code in PHP, the developers regularly switch between various
            programming languages. This is because of the way that PHP is generally utilized as a piece of the LAMP
            (Linux, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL, and PHP) stack.</p>
         <p class="body-text">Node.js, then again, regularly uses either MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and
            Node.js) or MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js) stack. The solitary programming language knowledge

         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Easy to learn and understand:</h4>
         <p class="body-text">Since Javascript stands to be perhaps the most well-known programming language, a large
            number of the front-end developers have decent information about it. It turns into significantly simpler for
            them to begin using the Node.js backend. It is very simple to learn Node.js and devour less an ideal
            opportunity to work with it.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. Fast backend development process:</h4>
         <p class="body-text">A point that advances beyond the Node.Js development versus PHP development war is that
            this framework might be utilized to support different simultaneous occasions. By using Node.js, the
            developers can shift well make adaptable tech solutions which augment the PC memory and CPU use as they
            serve different solicitations.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">3. More Flexible:</h4>
         <p class="body-text">At the point when we examine programming application development with Node.js, there are
            restricted rules and conditions. There are no standards requesting that software developers pick a pattern
            or structure, which gives them admittance to more than a huge number of various modules. Aside from this,
            there are various professionals that are a piece of Node.js, for example, Being like JS, it is a lot simpler
            to learn Node, it is ideal when working with immense records.</p>
         <p class="mt-5 technology-heading">Factors where Node.js lacks (Disadvantages)</p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. The climate is still little not so friendly:</h4>
         <p class="body-text">The use of a complex code structure is something that makes NodeJs a disappointing
            development stage for people.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. It isn't ideal for concentrated applications:</h4>
         <p class="body-text">This system can't be taking care of the escalated CPU exercises, for example, the age of
            sound and recordings, versions of designs, and so on The applications made by Node is more responsive, which

         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Maintenance:</h4>
         <p class="body-text">PHP structure is typically used to make the web application development process simpler
            and keep up the code consequently. The MVC design in PHP structure encourages the code to be utilized and
            kept up. These MVC developers to help the division of a document for every module independently.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. Stability:</h4>
         <p class="body-text">PHP is additionally very steady when contrasted with different programming languages. It
            has been in presence for a seriously long time. The software developers have dealt with PHP to make it
            simple for developers to chip away at building up the PHP online applications. They have fixed the bugs and
            issues throughout the particular timeframe for different adaptations of PHP and make it very steady.</p>
         <p class="mt-5 technology-heading">Weaknesses of PHP</p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Poor code sensibility:</h4>
         <p class="body-text">PHP gives the developers an opportunity to join HTML with the language punctuation that
            makes it much harder for them to expand the PHP applications with the new usefulness. Besides, it has gotten
            considerably more intense to deal with the codes with a particularly large code base: something that
            JavaScript structures scarcely face.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. Unable to deal with an enormous number of utilizations:</h4>

         <p class="body-text">The innovation is defenceless to help a lot of applications. It is exceptionally difficult
            to oversee since it isn't equipped measured. It as of now impersonates the critical features of Java
            language.</p>

         <p class="mt-5 technology-heading">The win-win approaches of PHP and NodeJS development:</p>
         <p class="mt-3 font-weight-bold"><em>Checkout the focal points where PHP registers its wins:</em></p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Blending code in with content</h4>
         <p class="body-text">You're composing or are adding thoughts into text for your site, and you need to add a
            branch to the process a little, on the off chance that assertion to make it look pretty, state, contingent
            upon some boundary in the URL. Or on the other hand, possibly you need to blend in content or information
            from a database. With PHP, you open up the wizardry PHP labels and begin composing code in practically no
            time. No requirement for formats as everything is a layout! No requirement for additional documents or
            expound models, just programmable strategic force readily available.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. Profound code base</h4>
         <p class="body-text">The web is loaded up with PHP code. The most well-known stages for building websites
            (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla) are written in PHP. Not exclusively are the stages open source, however, so are
            the majority of their modules. There's PHP code all over the place, and it's sitting tight for you to
            download, alter and use for your necessities.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">3. Straightforwardness</h4>
         <p class="body-text">There's very little to PHP: a couple of factors and fundamental capacities for shuffling
            strings and integers. It's a slender layer that doesn't do much with the exception of the move the database
            from port 80 to the database and back. That is the thing that it should do. A cutting edge database is an
            enchanted device, and it bodes well to leave the hard work to it. PHP is the perfect measure of intricacy
            for an occupation that shouldn't be perplexing.</p>
         <p class="body-text">On the other hand, in case, you're a developer who needs to accomplish more than
            collaborate with a database and formatted outcomes, you would now be able to accomplish more with PHP
            without holding your nose. Facebook's HHVM adds support for Hack, a total language loaded up with
            present-day features like sort explanations, generics and lambda articulations. Accessing this restricts
            your code to running just on the HHVM, however that is not the most exceedingly terrible thing on the
            planet.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">4. No customer application required</h4>
         <p class="body-text">The entirety of the discussion about utilizing a similar language in the program and on
            the server is decent, however, imagine a scenario where you don't have to utilize any language on the
            program. Imagine a scenario in which you transport the information in the HTML structure. Consider the
            possibility that you're fabricating an austere, static site to convey carefully what is required without the
            intelligent bling? The program pops it up, and there are no migraines or glitches brought about by fizzling
            JavaScript strings that attempt to make a page on the program from two dozen web administration calls.
            Unadulterated HTML works more frequently than all else, and PHP is streamlined to make that. What's the
            point of messing with JavaScript on the program? Develop everything on the server and try not to over-burden
            that little program on the little phone.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">5. SQL Server</h4>
         <p class="body-text">PHP was worked to exist together with MySQL and its numerous variations, like MariaDB. In
            the event that MySQL isn't spot on, there are other extraordinary SQL information bases from Oracle and
            Microsoft. Your code can switch with a couple of changes to your questions. The tremendous SQL world doesn't
            end at its boundaries. The absolute generally steady, very much created code will interface with a SQL
            information base, which means all that force can likewise be handily incorporated into a PHP project. It may
            not be one awesome, glad family, yet it's a major one. That, however, the information base world is
            gradually improving as developers discover approaches to add more knowledge to the data set so you don't
            have to function as hard.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">6. Coding speed</h4>
         <p class="body-text">For most developers, composing PHP development for web applications feels quicker: no
            compilers, no deployment, no JAR documents or preprocessors—basically your a proofreader and some PHP
            records in a catalogue. Your mileage will shift, yet with regards to slamming a project together rapidly,
            PHP is a decent web development platform to utilize.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">7. Competitive Environment</h4>
         <p class="body-text">The fight for the hearts and brains of PHP developers is as yet unfurling. The HHVM group
            and the Zend group are endeavouring to convey quick code for everybody. Free benchmarks are showing up, and
            everybody is stretching the codebases to the edge. This lone method better execution.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">8. Essential applications</h4>
         <p class="body-text">Over the most recent couple of years, a couple of developers have fired up web
            applications and wound up disappointed by the languid conduct. The JavaScript that drives those moving
            pieces can be a huge number of bytes. At the point when the entirety of the bundles show up, they should be
            parsed, accumulated, lastly executed all to convey a couple of bytes like the temperature and the
            conjecture.</p>
         <p class="body-text">TThe reaction against this extravagant madness can be found in the groups building static
            website generators (463 at this composition) and stripped-down pages in the AMP design. PHP is a
            characteristic decision for any group that needs to focus the insight on the server so the customer isn't
            overburdened.</p>
         <p class="mt-5 font-weight-bold"><em>Checkout the focal points where Node.Js development registers its wins:
            </em></p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Isolating concerns</h4>
         <p class="body-text">Blending code in with content is a bolster that can end up devastating you. Certainly,
            it's amusing to blend code in with HTML the initial a few times you do it. However, soon your codebase turns
            into a tangled wreck of rationale. Genuine developers add structure and separate the restorative layer from
            the intelligent layer. It's cleaner for new software engineers to comprehend and simpler to keep up. The
            structures running on Node.js are worked by software engineers who realize that life is better when the
            model, view, and regulator are discrete.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">2. More effective features</h4>
         <p class="body-text">Indeed, there are a huge number of incredible open sources PHP records, however, some are
            12-year-old WordPress modules trusting and imploring that somebody will download them. For each cutting edge
            form of Symfony, there is a dusty, since quite a while ago failed to remember the library that nobody
            refreshes.</p>
         <p class="body-text">Who needs to go through hours, days, or weeks monkeying with code that hasn't been
            refreshed in years? Node.js development modules are not just more up to date, they were worked with full
            information on the most recent structural methodologies. They were worked by software engineers who
            comprehend that advanced web applications should push the majority of the insight to the customer.</p>

         <p class="body-text">Keeping in mind that JavaScript has numerous little characteristics that make some
            frantic, generally, it is a cutting edge language that sports an advanced linguistic structure and a couple
            of valuable features like terminations. You can reconfigure and broaden it effectively, making amazing
            libraries like jQuery conceivable. You can pass capacities around like articles.</p>

         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">3. Many language choices</h4>
         <p class="body-text">If PHP clients are glad to gain admittance to Hack, they ought to consider moving to the
            universe of Node.js in light of the fact that many significant programming languages can be cross-compiled
            to run in JavaScript. There are notable choices like Java, C#, or Lisp and many others like Scala, OCaml and
            Haskell. There are even presents for nostalgic admirers of BASIC or Pascal. This list of languages that
            order to JavaScript from Jeremy Ashkenas is genuinely exhaustive. Besides JavaScript cousins like TypeScript
            and CoffeeScript offer marginally extraordinary and improved ways to deal with a similar game.</p>

         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">4. Administration calls are lighter weighted than HTML</h4>
         <p class="body-text">While AJAX-insane HTML-5 web applications can have too many moving parts, they are cool
            and exceptionally effective. When the JavaScript code is in the program reserve, the solitary thing that
            moves along the wires is the new information. There's not a huge load of HTML markup, and there are no
            rehashed excursions to download the whole page. Just the information has changed. In case you're willing to
            invest the energy to make a smooth program side web application, there's a major result. Node.js development
            is enhanced to convey the information and just the information through web administrations. In the event
            that your application is intricate and information-rich, it's a decent establishment for proficient
            conveyance.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">5. JSON</h4>
         <p class="body-text">If you approach SQL, Node.js has libraries to do that. Yet, Node.js likewise speaks JSON,
            the most widely used language for collaborating with large numbers of the most recent NoSQL database. Saying
            this doesn't imply that you can't get JSON libraries for your PHP development stack, however, there's a
            liquid thing about the direct way of working with JSON when utilizing JavaScript. It's one punctuation from
            the program to the webserver to the database. The colons and the wavy sections work a similar way all over.
            That by itself will save you from long periods of disappointment.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">6. Application speed</h4>
         <p class="body-text">Composing JavaScript code is somewhat harder when you're tallying wavy sections and
            enclosures, however when its set, your Node.js code can fly. The callback instrument is splendid on the
            grounds that it saves you from shuffling the strings. The centre is very much fabricated and intended to do
            all that for you. Isn't that what everybody needs?</p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">7. Solidarity</h4>
         <p class="body-text">Do you truly need two distinctive codebases? Without a doubt, rivalry (IT competition in
            languages) helps, yet discontinuity before long follows. What happens when your code runs on just one of the
            two? Rivalry doesn't do any great on the off chance that you need to go through weeks or months modifying
            your code. While Node.js encountered it's own fragmenting a couple of years back, with the dispatch of
            io.js, the Node.js universe has since rejoined, giving it the sort of language Solidarity that PHP
            developers may before long ache for.</p>
         <p class="mt-5 technology-heading">The key terms where both PHP development and Node.js development registers
            their win superbly</p>
         <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">Headless</h4>
         <p class="body-text">"Headless" refers to the PHP code running on the server. In some of the top PHP
            applications like Drupal have looked across the walkway and left away astounded by the modern UIs worked by
            the JavaScript systems like React, Angular, or Vue. Rather than attempting to competition them, they're
            surrendering control of the customer and focusing on working admirably with the back-end on the server.</p>
         <p class="body-text">In the event that you have to put a lot of resources into PHP code running on the server,
            this might be an approach to appreciate the best of the two methodologies. The old, set up PHP code goes
            about as a front way to the information base, twofold checking the solicitations, tidying up the
            information, and for the most part giving the entirety of the business sense. The customer side is a
            reformist web application composed of the most recent JavaScript system. At the point when it needs data, it
            ships off an AJAX solicitation to the PHP code.</p>
         <p class="body-text">This may not make meaning for some projects that begin scratch, however in the event that
            you've depended upon PHP for quite a long time and you need to push ahead steadily, this can be an upbeat
            trade-off.</p>
         <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Microservices and serverless </h4>
         <p class="body-text">The rising microservice or serverless standards offer a path for JavaScript and PHP code
            to live together with the worker and get along. The two arrangements split the work into many more modest
            administrations or capacities and these can run autonomously and remain in their paths. A few sections,
            generally the more seasoned and most stable areas of the application, can run PHP. Different parts,
            regularly the fresher ones, will be written in Node.js development. The language of the POST or GET can be
            the most widely used language that joins them all.</p>

         <p class="mt-5 technology-heading">Final words</p>
         <p class="body-text">To conclude, both Node.js and PHP are able to serve as a great server-side framework. Both
            of them have some pros and con, however, the amazing thing is that both are developed by the experts in
            order to make the web and mobile development better. As of in the final verdict, both Node.js and PHP can
            fill in as an extraordinary worker side system. The two of them have a few upsides and downsides, in any
            case, interestingly, both are created by the specialists to improve the web and portable turn of events.</p>
         <p class="body-text">While picking the innovation, your inquiry ought not to be which is better, rather it
            ought to be which one can serve your venture necessities in a superior manner. Understanding the business
            and project needs can give you a reasonable plan to picking the correct innovation stage for their venture.

                              <p>Definitely, node.js is tricky and a bit difficult platform to work on by being a

                              <p>Definitely. You can use NodeJS development with PHP. You should incorporate Node with
                                 your PHP application to do as such. You would have to design a few things to exploit
                                 Node's Event-based engineering before completely coordinating it for your PHP
                                 application.</p>

                           <div class="content">
                              <p>NodeJS and PHP are not there to supplant one another. Both have their own facts and
                                 features. In spite of the fact that NodeJS may appear as though a substitute for PHP,
                                 however, NodeJS developmemt services won't replace it. PHP's versatility and
                                 flexibility for web applications and sites can't be overtaken by NodeJS.
                                 Simultaneously, NodeJS is productive in enormous solicitations. Along these lines, both
                                 are autonomous and selective with regards to activities.</p>

In spite of the fact that NodeJS may appear as though a substitute for PHP, however, NodeJS developmemt services won't replace it. PHP's versatility and flexibility for web applications and sites can't be overtaken by NodeJS. Simultaneously, NodeJS is productive in enormous solicitations. Along these lines, both are autonomous and selective with regards to activities."
